This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum, aiming to replicate some functionalities of the AirBnB website. It starts with the back-end console, which is a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects.

## Description

The console is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This console will help us manage the application's data, performing tasks such as creating new instances of classes, retrieving an object from a file, performing operations on objects, updating attributes of an object, and destroying an object.

## Installation

To use the console, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JHMindSharp/AirBnB_clone.git 
```

## Usage

To launch the console in interactive mode, simply run:

```bash
./console.py
```

In non-interactive mode, echo your command and pipe it into the console like this:

```bash
echo "help" | ./console.py
```

## Supported Commands

quit: Exits the console
EOF: Exits the console
help: Displays the help documentation for commands
create: Creates a new instance of a class
show: Shows an instance of a class based on its ID
destroy: Deletes an instance based on its class name and ID
all: Shows all instances of a class or all instances of every class
update: Updates an instance based on its class name and ID by adding or updating an attribute
